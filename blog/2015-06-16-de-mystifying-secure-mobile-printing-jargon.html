And, increasingly, everybody needs to print from multiple devices, including laptops, smartphones, and tablets ? not just desktop computers. They print memos, presentations, sales literature, emails, web pages and a staggering variety of other documents, images, and files. So, of course, everybody understands the printing process, right?</p> 
                 <!--more--> <p>Not so fast, says Breezy's CEO Jared Hansen. ?The print industry is like any other industry, and it has its own jargon and unique technologies. It can be a challenge to understand the terminology.?</p> <p><a href="http://it-online.co.za/2015/05/18/simplifying-print-jargon/">One survey</a> by Canon says that 86% of print buyers don?t understand the technical language used by their IT department, and up to 43% had been unhappy with a print job because of the misunderstanding about terminology.</p> <p>But selecting the right print technology doesn?t have to be a mystery. Here?s a vocabulary list that will simplify the process of selecting the right print technology, securing the transfer of information to the printer, and managing what is printed, where it?s printed, and who has access to the information.</p> <h2>Airprint</h2> <p>AirPrint is a feature in Apple?s operating systems starting with OS X Lion and iOS 4.2.1, for printing via a wireless LAN (Wi-Fi), either directly to AirPrint-compatible printers (such as specific printer models from Lexmark, HP, Canon, Konica Minolta, Ricoh, Kyocera, Brother, or Epson), or to non-compatible printers by way of a Microsoft Windows or GNU/Linux PC, or an Apple Mac.</p> <p>?In the fall of 2010, when Apple first announced AirPrint, it was met with cheers from frustrated mobile users who thought that their printing problem had been solved at last. But it was not to be,? Hansen says. ?Although AirPrint has proved to be an excellent consumer-level technology, is not well-suited to the needs of most corporate environments.</p> <p>One of the biggest barriers is cost. AirPrint requires that printers support the Bonjour protocol and that all the devices using AirPrint run the Apple operating system. For most IT managers that would mean replacing most of a company?s existing printer fleet and standardizing on the brands supported by AirPrint ? and, of course, instead of allowing employees to bring their own devices (BYOD) regardless of operating system, it would limit the company?s mobile support to iPhone and iPad devices.</p> <p>AirPrint does not enable on-device encryption or pull printing, so security is one of the primary benefits IT looks for when selecting Breezy rather than AirPrint. Last, but hardly least, Airprint doesn?t work with the print management, accounting, and tracking software many companies need in order to control costs and track usage.</p> <h2>BYOD Printing</h2> <p>BYOD printing is the process of printing from a personally owned mobile device. ?Mobile devices work like small computers with the ability to share, edit, and process documents, images and information. But they nearly always lack a native printing function ? and getting the information from the mobile device to a printer securely is a vital part of securing the mobile devices that connect to your network,? says Hansen.</p> <p>Breezy?s secure mobile printing solution adds an extra layer of protection to the mobile devices that connect to your network or store your data. For more information on mobile device security and secure mobile printing, <a href="http://www.breezy.com/lastmile-video">watch this video</a> from Breezy, download <a href="../../../com/breezy/info/guide-to-mobile-printing-ebook.html">The Definitive Guide to Mobile Printing</a>, a free ebook, or <a href="../../../com/breezy/info/request-a-demo.html">click here</a> to schedule a Breezy demo now.</p> <h2>Cloud Printing</h2> <p><span>Cloud printing is the process of p</span>rinting from a computer or mobile device to a remote printer via the Internet (the cloud). This can be a very insecure process if the mobile device connects to a consumer-grade public cloud service, or the file is transferred to a public printer subject to a man-in-the-middle attack. Or it can be a very secure process, if the information is encrypted on the device, and decrypted only when it is actually printed. Breezy?s on-device encryption keeps cloud printing secure.</p> <h2>DPI</h2> <p>DPI stands for <em>dots per inch</em>. This is the resolution that the printer can produce. A higher DPI number means a higher quality print job. When a mobile device user is printing at a public print supplier, such as a copy shop or business center, selecting the right DPI setting can be critical, especially for photographs and marketing material. But selecting the highest DPI setting can increase costs unnecessarily if the document you?re printing doesn?t require high-resolution printing.</p> <h2>EMM</h2> <p>Enterprise mobility management (EMM) is an all-encompassing approach to securing and enabling business workers' use of smartphones and tablets. Breezy?s secure mobile printing technology is fully integrated with leading EMM providers like AirWatch, Aruba, Citrix, Good Technology, IBM (Fiberlink?s MaaS360), MobileIron and many others, and can add the extra layer of protection for secure mobile printing than can otherwise be missing.</p> <h2>Encryption</h2> <p>Encryption is a way to protect your wireless network from unwelcome users. It is optional but strongly recommended. By employing an encryption method, a password or key is used to code all of the messages sent over the wireless network. Only those devices that know the name of your network and the password can find and decode any network communications. The most common types of encryption are WEP and WPA.</p> <h2>Google Cloud Print</h2> <p>Google Cloud Print is a service from Google that allows printing to a Cloud Print-enabled printer connected to the Internet from Windows PCs, Macs, mobile devices and Chrome and Firefox browsers. Apps from Google and third parties enable printing from mobile devices, and the Chrome browser can display pages on an Android device.</p> <p>?There are a number of privacy and security concerns inherent in the way Google Cloud Print handles files,? Hansen says. ?One of the biggest is the retention policy ? that is, where copies of the file may reside after it is printed. If one of your employees uses this service to print a document while travelling, will a duplicate of it remain in the printer?s memory where a hacker could access it? In the cloud service itself? Those are the kind of concerns that keep CIOs up at night, I think.?</p> <h2><span>MDM, MAM</span></h2> <p>Mobile device management (MDM) is the administrative area dealing with deploying, securing, monitoring, integrating and managing mobile devices, such as smartphones, tablets and laptops, in the workplace. The intent of MDM is to optimize the functionality and security of mobile devices within the enterprise, while simultaneously protecting the corporate network.</p> <p>Where does secure mobile printing fit into an MDM solution? Unfortunately, Hansen says, it?s often an afterthought or completely absent. ?Breezy is fully integrated with the leading MDM and EMM solutions on the market, so you can be sure your MDM solution includes secure mobile printing within minutes of adding Breezy to it,? he adds.</p> <p>A mobile application manager (MAM) is a tool used by network administrators to remotely install, update, remove, audit, and monitor software programs installed on smartphones and tablets. ?This is a vital step in securing both the mobile device and the network, and in providing secure mobile printing,? Hansen says. ?Most EMM and MDM solutions include some level of MAM, but it?s critical to make sure that you are paying close attention to the apps installed on user?s mobile devices because so many of them are able to collect and transmit data that most CIOs want to protect.?</p> <h2><span>Pull-printing</span></h2> <p><span>Pull-printing is a term used to describe a print function that enables a user?s print job (file) to be held on a server until the user performs some type of authentication at the actual printer location which then releases the print job to the printer.</span> <span>User authentication is simply the act of identifying to the pull print system that the user has the authorization to release the actual file to the printer to be printed.</span></p> <p>British industry analyst firm <a href="../../../com/breezy/blog/dont-forget-mfps-when-planning-your-security-strategy.html">Quocirca say</a>s that about 70% of companies have experienced some kind of print-related security breach. ?Whether the breach happened because a sensitive document was left in a printer tray, or because a multi-function printer wasn?t secure, the fact is that pull-printing is important in an enterprise where sensitive information ? especially where information covered by government regulations like FINRA or HIPAA is common,? Hansen says.</p> <h2><span>Public Location Printing </span></h2> <p>Business travelers must often rely on public printing locations (copy shops, FedEx locations, hotel and airport business centers, etc.) to take care of last-minute document needs or changes. How secure a public printing location is shouldn?t be a concern ? and it doesn?t have to be with the Breezy Partner Network.</p> <p>Hansen says, ?The point of secure mobile printing is to let you be truly <em>mobile</em>. Wherever you roam, the Breezy Partner Network is there for you, with thousands of locations around the world including all FedEx Office locations across North America. An intuitive GPS feature makes it easy to find a nearby location, and a secure release code (provided in the Breezy app) protects documents until they are collected.?</p></span>
