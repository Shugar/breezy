				                 <span id="hs_cos_wrapper_post_body" class="hs_cos_wrapper hs_cos_wrapper_meta_field hs_cos_wrapper_type_rich_text" style="" data-hs-cos-general-type="meta_field" data-hs-cos-type="rich_text"><p><img title="2015_Gartner_Magic_Quadrant_5_EMM_Leader_Logos" style="float: right;" src="2014_Gartner_Magic_Quadrant_5_EMM_Leader_Logos.jpg?t=1441407402588" alt="2015_Gartner_Magic_Quadrant_5_EMM_Leader_Logos" align="right">Breezy integration partners AirWatch, Citrix, Good Technology, IBM and MobileIron made it into the coveted leaders' quadrant again this year in Gartner's <a href="http://www.air-watch.com/lp/gartner-magic-quadrant-for-enterprise-mobility-management-2015/">2015 Magic Quadrant for Enterprise Mobility Management Suite report</a>. Several other vendors (Symantec, Tangoe, and Absolute Software) were dropped, and Microsoft was included in the visionaries? quadrant for the first time along with smaller companies Sophos and Soti.</p> 
                 <!--more--> <p>Gartner analysts Terrence Cosgrove, Rob Smith, Chris Silva, John Girard and Brian Taylor compiled the new report, released on June 8, 2015, writing, ?Enterprise mobility management suites are the glue that connects mobile devices to their enterprise workflow.?</p> <p>But, the report added, ?The tools to manage mobility are no longer sufficient if their purpose is solely to manage device hardware functions. An ability to provide managed access, deliver and manage mobile apps, and facilitate access to content on tablets and smartphones is the expanded set of core features demanded of EMM tools."</p> <p>Jared Hansen, CEO and founder of secure mobile printing leader Breezy, says that the EMM market is constantly changing, as CIOs and IT managers identify critical functions and toolsets they need to stay on top of the evolving mobile device environment. ?When mobile device management (MDM) first arrived in the enterprise, provisioning ? that is configuring devices and applications for enterprise use ? was the most important function. Now that?s just one of many critical functions,? he says.</p> <p>Gartner rates EMM products on their ability to integrate mobile devices into the company?s security framework and IT life cycle, including:</p> 
                 <ul> 
                  <li>Provisioning.</li> 
                  <li>Auditing, tracking and reporting.</li> 
                  <li>Defense of enterprise data.</li> 
                  <li>Support &amp; troubleshooting.</li> 
                 </ul> <p>Four core technical categories ? mobile device management (MDM), mobile application management (MAM), preconfigured applications, and application extensions ? are considered when the analysts rank EMM products. Hansen said, ?We are proud that Breezy is among the third-party apps preconfigured and fully integrated with all of the leading EMM vendors in the new Magic Quadrant report.?</p> <p>He points out that easy-to-use mobile device printing remains the ?most wanted? feature by mobile device users who can quickly become frustrated with the inability to print documents, email, webpages, images and other files from their mobile devices. ?Since Breezy is integrated with all of the top performers in Gartner?s Magic Quadrant, it takes IT only a few minutes to enable secure mobile printing for every Android or iOS device in the enterprise when they add Breezy?s enterprise application to their preferred EMM suite,? Hansen says.</p> <p>Gartner considered more than 100 vendors for the updated Magic Quadrant Report. To be included, vendors had to meet the following criteria:</p> 
                 <ul> 
                  <li>At least $12 million in 2014 EMM revenue.</li> 
                  <li>Five reference customers using the EMM product.</li> 
                  <li>Support iOS, Android and Windows Phone.</li> 
                  <li>Included MDM, MAM through app wrapping or an SDK, and MCM.</li> 
                 </ul> <p>Additional functions considered, but not required, included:</p> 
                 <ul> 
                  <li>Advanced MAM that manages PIMs, browsers and other applications</li> 
                  <li>Support for Mac OS X and Windows</li> 
                  <li>Mobile identity and access through capabilities such as certificate management, enabling single sign-on on mobile devices, and executing "contextual authentication" through dynamic conditions, such as time, location, user and device posture</li> 
                  <li>Mobile analytics to understand usage trends and support troubleshooting</li> 
                  <li>File-level protections to protect data consumed or created in a mobile context</li> 
                 </ul> <h2>Interesting Data from the June EMM Magic Quadrant Report</h2> <p><img style="float: right;" src="http://cdn2.hubspot.net/hubfs/216929/Gartner_EMM_Magic_Quadrant.jpg?t=1441407402588" alt="Gartner_EMM_Magic_Quadrant" align="right">In addition to its vendor rankings and analysis, the new Gartner report includes some interesting data. For example, the report estimates that the average enterprise now deploys between eight and 15 mobile applications to employees. Where mobile strategy previously consisted wholly of basic, horizontal productivity tools like email, contacts and calendar, role-specific and mission-critical apps and data are increasingly the bulk of what is being pushed to users' mobile devices.</p> <p>This change, Gartner says, increases the need for application-level controls and reporting, along with the ability to deliver and consume a growing number of content types is at the heart of many mobile strategies. ?What that means, is that simple hardware device management isn?t enough anymore,? Hansen notes.</p> <p>Another change noted in the new report is that users no longer have a single mobile device. Employees now have a smartphone, a tablet and a laptop and, more often than not, they want to use a personally-owned device as part of a BYOD program. As a result, it has become important to determine not just who is connected to the network but whether they are connected with a corporate-authorized device. This is why Gartner recognizes mobile identity as a key pillar in EMM. Context ? that is identifying not only the user and device, but where and how a user connects to the network ? has become critical.</p> <p>?The same device, carried by the same user, may have a very different risk profile depending on the context,? Hansen says.?Is the device connecting to the network in the office, at home, on a public Wi-Fi network, or from another country?? Gartner expects contextually based mobile identity to become standard functionality within EMM products by 2017.</p> <p>In interviews with the reference customers supplied by vendors in the new Magic Quadrant report, Gartner noted the following trends:</p> 
                 <ul> 
                  <li>40% were using their EMM tools for vertical use cases beyond basic productivity</li> 
                  <li>30% were supporting shared devices</li> 
                  <li>19% were using their EMM tools to support contactors using personal devices</li> 
                  <li>59% use their EMM tools to manage internally developed applications</li> 
                  <li>56% stated that they use EMM to manage apps received from third parties and delivered through internal app stores</li> 
                  <li>58% percent were supporting public app store apps</li> 
                  <li>87% support iOS, 75% support Android and 37% support the Windows phone</li> 
                 </ul> <h2>Critical Capabilities for Enterprise Mobility</h2> <p>Hansen says that a related Gartner report published a week after the EMM Magic Quadrant, called <em><a href="http://www.air-watch.com/resources/analyst-reports/gartner-magic-quadrant-for-enterprise-mobility-management-2015/download/">Critical Capabilities for Enterprise Mobility</a></em>, identifies the two areas IT must understand before making an EMM purchase.</p> <p>The first step is to identify the way your employees use mobile devices in their everyday jobs, and develop use cases for specific tasks. Then look at the vendors who can best support those use cases. ?The absolute need to print a wide range of documents is often forgotten unless you talk to end users and pay close attention to the reasons they use their mobile devices every day,? he notes.</p> <p>The second step is to identify the critical mobile applications for your organization, and select vendors that work best with those applications.</p> <p>Mobile devices allow workers to be more productive, and are critical in how companies engage with customers, make sales, and handle information on a day-to-day basis. But, without operational integrity and reliability, Gartner says, those benefits can?t be maintained.</p> <p>Breezy delivers device and operating system agnostic secure mobile printing with on-device encryption for smartphones and tablets running Android and iOS operating systems. Breezy?s secure mobile printing technology is fully integrated with leading EMM providers like AirWatch, Aruba, Citrix, Good Technology, IBM (Fiberlink?s MaaS360), MobileIron and many others, and can add an extra layer of protection to the mobile devices that connect to your network or store your data.
